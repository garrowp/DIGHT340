</p><div class="sports-list"><h2>Major League Baseball</h2><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Texas_Rangers.svg"/><p>The Texas Rangers are an American professional baseball team based in Arlington, Texas, located in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The Rangers franchise currently competes in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the American League (AL) West division. Since 1994, the Rangers have played in Globe Life Park in Arlington. The team name is borrowed from the famous law enforcement agency of the same name. The franchise was established in 1961 as the Washington Senators, an expansion team awarded to Washington, D.C., after the city&#x27;s first AL ballclub, the second Washington Senators, moved to Minnesota and became the Twins (the original Washington Senators played primarily in the National League during the 1890s). After the 1971 season, the new Senators moved to Arlington, and debuted as the Rangers the following spring. The Texas Rangers Baseball Club has made eight appearances in the MLB postseason, seven following division championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016 and as a wild card team in 2012. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for the first time, defeating the Tampa Bay Rays. Texas then brought home their first American League pennant after beating the New York Yankees in six games. In the 2010 World Series, the franchise&#x27;s first, the Rangers fell to the San Francisco Giants in five games. They repeated as American League champions the following year, then lost the 2011 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games.</p></div><div class="sports-list"><h2>National Basketball Association</h2><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/97/Dallas_Mavericks_logo.svg"/><p>The Dallas Mavericks (often referred to as the Mavs) are an American professional basketball team based in Dallas, Texas. The Mavericks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league&#x27;s Western Conference Southwest Division. The team plays its home games at the American Airlines Center, which it shares with the National Hockey League&#x27;s Dallas Stars As of the 2017 season, the Mavericks have sold out 704 consecutive games since December 15, 2001, the longest currently running sellout streak in North American major league sports. Since their inaugural 1980–81 season, the Mavericks have won three division titles (1987, 2007, 2010), two conference championships (2006, 2011), and one NBA championship (2011).</p></div><div class="sports-list"><h2>National Football League</h2><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Dallas_Cowboys.svg"/><p>The Dallas Cowboys are a professional American football team based in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The Cowboys compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league&#x27;s National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team is headquartered in Frisco, Texas, and plays its home games at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, which opened for the 2009 season. The stadium took its current name prior to the 2013 season. The Cowboys joined the NFL as an expansion team in 1960. The team&#x27;s national following might best be represented by its NFL record of consecutive sell-outs. The Cowboys&#x27; streak of 190 consecutive sold-out regular and post-season games (home and away) began in 2002. The franchise has made it to the Super Bowl eight times, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Denver Broncos for second most Super Bowl appearances in history, just behind the New England Patriots record ten Super Bowl appearances. This has also corresponded to eight NFC championships, most in the NFC. The Cowboys have won five of those Super Bowl appearances, tying them with their NFC rivals, the San Francisco 49ers, and the AFC&#x27;s Patriots; all three are second to Pittsburgh&#x27;s record six Super Bowl championships. The Cowboys are the only NFL team to record 20 straight winning seasons (1966–85), in which they missed the playoffs only twice (1974 and 1984), an NFL record that remains unchallenged. In 2015, the Dallas Cowboys became the first sports team to be valued at $4 billion, making it the most valuable sports team in the world, according to Forbes. The Cowboys also generated $620 million in revenue in 2014, a record for a U.S. sports team. In 2018 they also became the first NFL franchise to be valued at $5 billion and making Forbes&#x27; list as the most valued NFL team for the 12th straight year.</p></div><div class="sports-list"><h2>Major League Soccer</h2><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c9/FC_Dallas_logo.svg"/><p>FC Dallas is an American professional soccer club based in the Dallas suburb of Frisco, Texas.
