</p><div class="dogs-list"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Golden_Retriever_Carlos_%2810581910556%29.jpg"/><p>The Golden Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog bred as gun dogs to retrieve shot waterfowl, such as ducks and upland game birds, during hunting and shooting parties, and were named &#x27;retriever&#x27; because of their ability to retrieve shot game undamaged (soft mouth). Golden retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water. Golden retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments. They shed copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and require fairly regular grooming. The Golden Retriever was originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century.</p><h2>Golden Retriever</h2></div><div class="dogs-list"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Rhodesian_ridgeback.jpg"/><p>The Rhodesian Ridgeback is a dog breed developed in the Southern Africa region. Its forebears can be traced to the semi-domesticated, ridged hunting dogs of the Khoikhoi, which were crossed with European dogs by the early colonists of the Cape Colony of southern Africa. The original breed standard was drafted by F. R. Barnes, in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), in 1922, who named the breed the Rhodesian Ridgeback. The standard was approved by the South African Kennel Union in 1927.</p><h2>Rhodesian Ridgeback</h2></div><div class="dogs-list"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Duitse_staande_korthaar_10-10-2.jpg"/><p>The German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP) is a medium to large sized breed of dog developed in the 19th century in Germany for hunting. A versatile hunting breed, being an all-purpose gun breed of dog suitable for both land and water, it is streamlined yet powerful with strong legs that make it able to move rapidly and turn quickly. It has moderately long floppy ears set high on the head. Its muzzle is long, broad, and strong, allowing it to retrieve even heavy game. The dog&#x27;s profile should be straight or strongly Roman nosed; any dished appearance to the profile is incorrect. The eyes are generally brown, with darker eyes being desirable; yellow or bird of prey eyes are a fault. The tail is commonly docked, although this is now prohibited in some countries. In the current breed standard the tail is docked at approximately 40% of its length before it curves. In competition the dog is penalized if the tail is curved either up or down while the dog is moving. When the GSP is in classic point stance, the tail should be held straight out from the body, forming a line with the pointing head and body. Like all German pointers, GSPs have webbed feet. They are known for going after water fowl in the water.</p><h2>German Short Haired Pointer</h2></div></div></main></div></main><div><img id="cover-picture" src="./assets/images/dallas.jpg"/></div></div><footer><p>Read more about Dallas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas">here</a></p>
